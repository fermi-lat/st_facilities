/**

 * @brief Yet another environment interface.  This provides access to
 * facilities::commonUtilities functions that rely on environment
 * variables.  By implementing as a Singleton and providing access to
 * the underlying functions only via the Singleton object, this class
 * ensures that the facilities::commonUtilities::setupEnvironment()
 * function is called without having to burden the clients with this
 * task.
